![Image of code while running](src/rpg_manager.png)

A terminal-based RPG character management system with data visualization, statistical analysis, and random content generation. The program lets you build and manage a full roster of characters, track their attributes, skills, and inventory, and now includes charts, pandas-powered stat analysis, and Faker-generated backstories and quests.
 
## How to Use
 
1. Run `main.py` from inside the project folder.
2. Use the numbered menu to navigate between all features.
3. Add characters manually or generate random ones using the Random Generator.
4. Manage each character's skills, inventory, and attributes through their dedicated menus.
5. Use Character Visualization to generate radar charts and bar graphs for any character.
6. Use Statistical Analysis to view roster-wide stats, filter by class, or sort by any attribute.
7. Use Data Management to export your roster to CSV or import characters from a previous export.
